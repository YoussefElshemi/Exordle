### Game

Exordle is based on the popular trivia game, Wordle. However, our idea of the game intergrates geolocation and is soley based around the University of Exeter. Players are expected to login using their university email addresses which will limit players to only students at the university. The premise of the game is to guess a word related to campus, hints will be given to players if they interact with others by scanning another player's QR code. A player can only scan another player's QR code one time, and they can only get hints every 5 minutes. The player needs to be close to the other player to prohibit players from sending QR codes unless they are actually together. Scanning a staff member's QR code will provide a player with a jumbo hint which gives them extra letter hint.

Player's will be able to compete against other students, teachers, members of their societies and also their friends. Their statistics will be stored, such as number of guesses taken, number of hints used and streaks, and a public leaderboard will be available to them which lets players have an understanding as to how well they are doing in comparison to others.
